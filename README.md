ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Sofia

I am a computer engineer and full-stack developer. Outside of my job, I enjoy working on my personal projects and learning new skills that will take me further in the field.

I am constantly looking for challenges and situations that will push me to become a better software developer. I enjoy working in fast-paced and dynamic environments that push me out of my comfort zone and help me grow professionally. 

I have a passion for coding and designing projects, particularly focused on full-stack, mobile, and web development. 

 ðŸŒ± Currently:
- Working as a full-stack Software Developer at Svante Inc.
- Helping carbon capture researchers through tailored app development
- Graduated in Computer Engineering at the University of British Columbia
